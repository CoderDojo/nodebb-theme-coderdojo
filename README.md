# CoderDojo Theme for NodeBB

The CoderDojo theme is based off the [Vanilla](https://github.com/NodeBB/nodebb-theme-vanilla) base theme.

See [NodeBB Theme Documentation](https://docs.nodebb.org/en/latest/themes/create.html) for more information. Also search for `nodebb-theme` on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=nodebb-theme) for inspiration.

## Features

* overrides the login template to show the CoderDojo logo & text
* overrides the login language file to be CoderDojo specific (only English for now)

In the future this theme will be used to make the Forums more like the rest of the CoderDojo sites.
